      Welcome to my website. <br>
      It is still very much in construction, as you can see. I want to finish the
      navigation bar; Currently, some of the links are not working, but I am slowly
      creating all of them. For now, those are available:
      <li>The About Page, though it is still empty right now </li>
      <li>My Resume Page, which for now has a basic replica of my resume</li>
      <br>
      I fixed the fonts but I am still working on other aspects such as the
      colour schemes lol. I now have a dark mode (I hope you guys like
      the colours - kind of inspired by sunsets a bit I guess lol)
      <br> The website is also almost perfect on the phone. Lastly, I have an
      interesting idea for a sort of project which would become very useless the
      more I work on the site but let's try.
      <br>
      Not to worry though, I am slowly fixing and building up everything.
      <br>
      So, enjoy ^^

      I am originally from Mauritius, which is a small island in the Indian Ocean.
      So, for now, there is only my resume here because I have not been able
      to write anything down as much with COVID-19 and the Fall semester
      adjustment for assignments. However, rest assured that this website will
      be developed further in the coming weeks.
