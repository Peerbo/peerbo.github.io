            I was finally able to add in this update box, and I could not be more
            proud of myself. That's because I actually did this mostly by myself,
            as in I took some parts of code from different styles I wanted to have
             (the transitions for example), but then adapted them to fit what I was
            doing.
            <br>
            <br>Now, here we are with this amazing sliding update box.
          </div>
          <div class="txt">
            However, I have to say that this bar is actually still lacking a lot in
            terms of content because I literally just created it. I will be filling
            in for the past days as I keep working on the website.
            <br>Furthermore, this bar is currently only for PCs and will 100% be weird
            on phone screens. Just as the updates, give me some time and I will fix
            this. I'll also try and find for a better sea pun for that title lol.
            <br>
            <br>For now, hope you like this little update sidebar ^^

        Welcome to my website. <br>
        It is still very much in construction, as you can see. I want to finish the
        navigation bar; Currently, some of the links are not working, but I am slowly
        creating all of them. For now, those are available:
        <ul>
          <li>The About Page, though it is still empty right now </li>
          <li>My Resume Page, which for now has a basic replica of my resume</li>
        </ul>
        I fixed the fonts but I am still working on other aspects such as the
        colour schemes lol. I now have a dark mode (I hope you guys like
        the colours - kind of inspired by sunsets a bit I guess lol)
        <br> The website is also almost perfect on the phone. Lastly, I have an
        interesting idea for a sort of project which would become very useless the
        more I work on the site but let's try.
        <br>
        <br>
        Dec 21, 2020
        <br> Quick update, I actually finished the project, and now all the pages
        "work", as in they're present but show the same thing for now lol. But still,
        I love the little surprise so I added an extra part in the navigation bar
        just for it, especially for later when all the pages will be done. Also, this
        project currently does not support dark mode, atleast the main part of it.
        <br>
        Furthermore, the navigation bar right now only has what I think I will add so this too
        will probably be updated as I work more and more on this website ^^
        <br>
        <br>
        But for now, I can say that I am slowly advancing towards getting the perfect
        design. So, enjoy ^^

        As I am writing this, I am in quarantine in a hotel in my home country
        for two weeks because I wanted to go back for winter break. This is a
        mandatory procedure for anyone coming in, but I knew I would be very
        bored throughout that time. In comes a few of my friends who suggested
        the idea of creating a website (mostly by showing me theirs lol).
        <br>
        <br>Having nothing else to do, I actually went through with this idea.
        <br>Until now, this has been an awesome experience, and I hope I'll be
        able to keep on improving this website even further until it becomes
        perfect -for me at least. In case people would be interested in the
        future, this <span onclick="openNav()" style="color: var(--circle1-color);">
        update box</span> has all of my past improvements on this site.
        <br>
        <br>However, all I want to say right now is thanks so much Sneha and
        Sasha, you guys rock ^^
        <br>In case anyone visiting might want to see their websites, the links
        will be in my <a href="contact.html" style="color: var(--circle1-color);
         text-decoration: none;">contacts</a> page.
        <br>
        <br>Thanks for reading this personal note, and I hope you enjoy
        the website <span class= "heart">&#10084;</span>
